# landscape generator

There are two parts to this:
 - console demo (nodejs-demo.js)
 - web demo (index.html, app.js, random.js)

## How to run

console demo can be run using: `node nodejs-demo.js`

web demo is run using a browser or a web server (e.g. `http-server .`)

## About

The console demo creats a landscape that is created using keyboard characters. User can use left and right keys to traverse the landscape. User can exit with 'q', 'escape', or 'ctrl-c'.


The web demo is closer to what will be used in the end result.  Now that the basics of the landscape generation have been done, this focuses on building a better visualization using the canvas.
